# MovieCorrelation

DataAnalysis and Visualization of Movies via Pandas,Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib from a public database. Using Jupyter Notebooks. 

The purpose was to pull data from an excel and manipulate the raw data for a company or presentation. 

The genesis of the project came from learning about Data Anayltics from the Youtuber Alex the Data Analyst and my own curiousity to utilize programming and technology to make sense the raw data being produced, from the advent of the internet in the Third Industrial revolution going from logarithmic change to exponential advancement. And I am a self proclaimed cinophile so utilizing his tutroial I was able to add more graphs and edit the data interpretation to provide more graphs. The graphs focused on Gross profit and attempt to find correlation with Director, budget and profit with genre that could be utilized with a marketing team for an example of financial benefit to a company. 

I really want to delve deeper into inflations role in the movie industry and what constitutes a box office bomb and the potential financial recuperation if a box office bomb becomes a "cult classic", Python and especially Pandas and Matplotlib are primed to analyze this data throught open source sharing.
